# WCPFC tissue bank: Simple power analysis to support development of sampling plans
This repository implements a relatively simple power analysis to support the development
of sampling plans for the WCPFC tissue bank, initiated in 2024.

A simulation framework is implemented, parameterised by information from MFCL files,
with an (assumed) underlying population, with fisheries extracting catch from the population
from which samples are taken as described by a sampling plan.
