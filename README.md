# WCPFC tissue bank: Simple power analysis to support development of sampling plans
These scripts implement a relatively simple power analysis to support the development
of sampling plans for the WCPFC tuna tissue bank. A simulation framework is implemented,
with an (assumed) underlying population, with fisheries extracting catch from the population
from which samples are taken as described by a sampling plan.
